### How long did you spend on the challenge?
I spent three hours on this challenge

### What did you learn in this project?
I have not used lifecycle methods since I coded my first project in React. It took me a while to adjust. <br/> I have been using hooks for the last few months and it was much easier than using the lifecycle methods. <br/> Additionally, I have been trying to use TypeScript and coding the hooks component with TS taught me a lot. 

### What do you like about your implementation?
I like my use of hooks and TypeScript.

### What you would change if you were going to do it again?
I would add in more APIs and pages via React Router.

### How did you make your design decisions?
I used Coolers.Co to find a color that complimented Cornflowerblue.
